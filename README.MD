# Scraping Test

Write a Python program to get the number of followers of a specific account on Twitter (taking an url as an input, for example https://twitter.com/KMbappe)

# Time Spent

45 Minutes

# Python and external modules used

- Python 3.7.0
- Selenium
- Chromedriver version 87

# Problems

As first I utilized the requests library but after sometime I realized the requests library can no longer fetch a Twitter page
hence I use selenium to open the link
